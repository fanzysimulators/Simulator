      "Players must start on one of three containers. Once the challenge starts, players must run and jump off the first container into the water and swim around a buoy and then climbing up the second container. Once on the second container, players must rope swing to the third container. On the third container, which is at a severe angle, players must grab a ring and slide down the container back into the water and swim back to the second. They must climb up the second container and place a ring around a pole. The last placing guy and girl are eliminated.",
